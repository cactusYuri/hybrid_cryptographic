    A placeholder for a Verkle Tree implementation.
    A full implementation requires polynomial commitments (e.g., KZG) over
    elliptic curve pairings, which is a heavy dependency. For the purpose
    of this benchmark structure, we are creating a mock class.
    
    The performance characteristics (from the paper) would be:
    - Witness Size: Nearly constant, very small.
    - Prover Time: Slower than Merkle due to polynomial math.
    - Verifier Time: Fast, a few pairing checks.
